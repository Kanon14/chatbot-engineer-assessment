<Outlet Operation Verification>
Challenge:
The outlet database was scraped manually and may not reflect real-time updates 
(like holidays, special closures, or current time), required a verification mechanism 
to ensure the chatbot doesn’t give misleading info.

Solution:
- Time check
- Tavily to search for public holidays, special closures, and current time

<Testing Chatnbot>
Observation:
- SQL return multiple rows if specified a specific location, chatbot did not prompt the user to specify where.
- The product vector store can't retrieve the variant row for the products.


<Product Catalogue Chaos>
- YAML file is better for structured data, not all product share the same information.
- It is better to convert into pdf version.
